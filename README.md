# Hosting
##1. Choose a VPS Plan
Purchase a VPS plan on Hostinger or another provider.
Make sure it meets your app's resource requirements, such as storage, memory, and bandwidth.

##2. Access the VPS
Once your VPS is ready, log in to the server using SSH. Youâ€™ll need the IP address, username, and password (or private key).
On Windows, you can use an SSH client like PuTTY, and on macOS/Linux, you can use the terminal:

```http
  ssh username@your_vps_ip
```
