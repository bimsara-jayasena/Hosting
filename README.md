# Hosting
<h1>1. Choose a VPS Plan</h1>
Purchase a VPS plan on Hostinger or another provider.
Make sure it meets your app's resource requirements, such as storage, memory, and bandwidth.

<h2>2. Access the VPS</h2>
Once your VPS is ready, log in to the server using SSH. Youâ€™ll need the IP address, username, and password (or private key).
On Windows, you can use an SSH client like PuTTY, and on macOS/Linux, you can use the terminal:
<code>ssh username@your_vps_ip</code>
